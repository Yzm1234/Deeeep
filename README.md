## Deeeep group project for CMU 11785 Introduction to Deep Learning

### Baseline models
1. Exploiting Spatial Structure for Localizing Manipulated Image Regions

### Data

1. COVERAGE - We use image/*t.tif and mask/*forged.tif for input and label

### TODO
1. Preprocess the images to have the same size - better to use crop rather than using resize, since resize may distort the original images
